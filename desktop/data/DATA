Hello,


It was nice meeting with you all.


Send me the lesson plan as a MS word attachment for possible 8 sessions, ti=
tle of the program, targeted age group, and learning outcomes.


Also, Aadit and Ritvik need to send me the name of their adult volunteers. =
Srihari's mom is finger printed and volunteered with us before. This way th=
ree adults can turns in volunteering for our program. Without adult presenc=
e we won't be able to offer the program since it is a requirement.




Thank you,


Aasia A.
