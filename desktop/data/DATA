Here is the Word-formatted curriculum.
I have given contradictory messages regarding availability of co-teachers, =
so just to recap: I have an available co-teacher, so no e-mailing to member=
s necessary.

Hello, Aasia!

The attached document lists all important details pertinent to the new clas=
s. It also gives a week-by-week listing of the curriculum.

It is probably better that you send out an e-mail to teensReach volunteers =
looking for someone interested in teaching, as I have not received replies =
from my friends yet.
